#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Saves:
# - X_norm.npy: normalized windowed EEG (numpy array, trials x channels x time) 
# - (commented out)X_flat.npy: flattened version (numpy array, trials x (channels*time))
# - X_features.npy: features (numpy array, trials x (channels*5))
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
# Notes:
# - X_norm is the time-series EEG for spike encoding / SNN input
# - X_features is an optional representation for ML baselines (shouldn't hurt to have both saved for flexibility)

#replaced variance features with peak-to-peak, var and activity are similar but ptp may capture more dynamic range 
# in the signal, keeping 5 features per channel

#if we ever need to flatten data for model input, we can do that after normalization, but we want the 3D shape 
#X_flat = X_norm.reshape(X_norm.shape[0], -1)  # 2D numpy array: (trials, channels*time)
#print("Flattened array for model input:", X_flat.shape)
#np.save("X_flat.npy", X_flat)


#can add time window selection before normalization if we want to focus on specific time ranges, 
# but since epochs are already time-constrained, we can skip this step for now. If needed, we can uncomment 
# and adjust the time window as necessary.

# Time window selection 
# tmin, tmax = 200, 500 # ms, expanded time window to capture more response, adjust as needed
#time_mask = (times >= tmin) & (times <= tmax)
#X_window = X[:, :, time_mask]
#print("Shape after time window selection:", X_window.shape)

# if this is not fast enough --> import eeglib # for feature extraction, install via pip if needed (pip install eeglib)
